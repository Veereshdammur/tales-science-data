#Â Tales of Science & Data

## What's this

This Gitbook is a personally elaborated collection of material on Data Science.

## Structure and components

I gave the material the organisation which to me makes more sense, this does not mean that it's the best organisation ever. In fact, some of the topics treated could be potentially categorised differently.

Each single topic lives in its own file so that it can be read as isolated from all the rest.

At end of each file I report the references I used to elaborate the material.
