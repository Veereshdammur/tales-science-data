# Tales of Science & Data

**A semi-serious collection of notes on Data Science**

## What's this?

This repo contains a series of Jupyter notebook intended as a collection of personally elaborated material on Data Science. 

Topics span a quite large spectrum in the Data Science field: nothing will ever be fully comprehensive, but the purpose is keeping this continuously updated. Learning never ends! This here serves as the table of contents and links all material together.

### Meta
 
What exactly is this? Why did I even bother doing this? How did I choose to do this?

* The [**about**](about.md) gives a (sorta) detailed explanation from conception till realisation, and the structure and choices (it's a bit of a stream of consciousness)
* The [**adminy**](adminy.md) documents the folders which are supporting material

## Table of Contents

Again, material span a quite large and insane set of topics. None of them is treated comprehensively, so your risk.
