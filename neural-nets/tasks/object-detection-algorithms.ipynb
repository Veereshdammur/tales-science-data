    "Obj detection: usual CNN with last dense layer won't work as length of it is not known - number of objs to detect not fixed. Naive approach with CNNs: separate img into regions and use CNN for classification of those; but objects may overlap and have different aspect ratios and different locations. Means huge number of regions to use, which is computationally expensive.\n",
