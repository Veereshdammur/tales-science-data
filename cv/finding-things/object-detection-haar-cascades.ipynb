    "Haar cascades [[1]](#haar) is a method typically used to detect the presence of faces in a image, but it is a general way to detect generic objects. It works by training a cascade function on features extracted from many positive (contain object) and negative (do not contain object) images.\n",

    "The Figure illustrates the Haar features: edge features (A); line features (B); four-rectangle features (C). Adjacent rectangular regions of target size are moved over the image, the sum of pixels' intensities under the two (black and white) regions is calculated and then the difference of these, which is compared to a learned threshold. Said threshold  is such to separate object from no-object in the training images. For example, to detect eyes, because the pixels in the eyes regions are darker than those in the cheeks, a line feature with the dark part above would be a good feature.\n",

What actually happens is that the algorithm uses *integral images*: 2-dimensional lookup tables containing the sum of pixels in the top-left part of the original image. The Figure on the left illustrates the concept, which can be formulated as \n",

Following the image, the sum would be $D-B-C+A$, where the letters indicate the respective areas top-left of points: only four lookups are then needed,  and here is why this makes everything much faster.\n",
