It uses the tristimulus values: the human eye has three kinds of cone cells, each of which has the peak of sensitivity for light at a given wavelength, so three parameters can be used, corresponding to the levels of the stimuli to the three types of cells.\n",
    "* **RGB** (red, green, blue): describes what light produces a given colour. Several colour spaces can be derived from this model.\n",
    "* **YUV** (luma plus chroma): it is built with a luma (brightness, achromatic) value and two chroma (colour information) values. **YPbPr** is its scaled version and **YCbCr** is its scaled digital version.\n",
    "* **HSV**, also known as **HSB** (hue, saturation, value/brightness): is a coordinate transformation of RGB (a cube) into a cylindrical space. Note  that there is also **HSL** (L for lightness), which is similar. The hue is defined as the  degree to which a stimulus can be described as similar tor different t o the unique hues (red, green, blue and yellow, those perceived as pure by an observer). The saturation is a measure of intensity: it represents the colourfullness of a colour relative to its brightness. The value, or brightness, contains no colour information. The HSV space is a cylinder: $H \\in [0,359], S,V \\in [0,100]$.\n",
    "* **CMYK** (cyan, magenta, yellow, key -black-):  it is used in printing, describes what inks need to be used so that the reflected light produces the given colour\n",

    "* **XYZ**: humans perceive light  in the green (medium) part of the electromagnetic spectrum  as brighter than those in the red (long) and the blue (short) parts of the spectrum.  Y is the *luminance*;  Z the *blue stimulation*; X is a linear combination of the cone responses. So, at fixed X, the plane XZ contains all the  cromaticities at that luminance. The cromaticity is the quality of colour regardless of luminance and is given by hue and saturation."
